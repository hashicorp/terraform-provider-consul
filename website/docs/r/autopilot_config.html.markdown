# consul_autopilot_config

Provides access to the [Autopilot Configuration](https://www.consul.io/docs/guides/autopilot.html)
of Consul to automatically manage Consul servers.

It includes to automatically cleanup dead servers, monitor the status of the Raft
cluster and stable server introduction.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "consul_autopilot_config" "config" {
	cleanup_dead_servers      =  false
	last_contact_threshold    =  "1s"
	max_trailing_logs         =  500
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `datacenter` - (Optional) The datacenter to use. This overrides the
  datacenter in the provider setup and the agent's default datacenter.

* `cleanup_dead_servers` - (Optional) Whether to remove failing servers when a
replacement comes online. Defaults to true.

* `last_contact_threshold` - (Optional) The time after which a server is
considered as unhealthy and will be removed. Defaults to `"200ms"`.

* `max_trailing_logs` - (Optional) The maximum number of Raft log entries a
server can trail the leader. Defaults to 250.

* `server_stabilization_time` - (Optional) The period to wait for a server to be
healthy and stable before being promoted to a full, voting member. Defaults to
`"10s"`.

* `redundancy_zone_tag` - (Optional) The [redundancy zone](https://www.consul.io/docs/guides/autopilot.html#redundancy-zones)
tag to use. Consul will try to keep one voting server by zone to take advantage
of isolated failure domains. Defaults to an empty string.

* `disable_upgrade_migration` - (Optional) Whether to disable [upgrade migrations](https://www.consul.io/docs/guides/autopilot.html#redundancy-zones).
