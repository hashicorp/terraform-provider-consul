# Consul Provider

[Consul](https://www.consul.io) is a tool for service discovery, configuration
and orchestration. The Consul provider exposes resources used to interact with a
Consul cluster. Configuration of the provider is optional, as it provides
defaults for all arguments.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

~> **NOTE:** The Consul provider should not be confused with the [Consul remote
state backend][consul-remote-state-backend], which is one of many backends that
can be used to store Terraform state. The Consul provider is instead used to
manage resources within Consul itself, such as adding external services or
working with the key/value store.

[consul-remote-state-backend]: /docs/backends/types/consul.html

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Configure the Consul provider
provider "consul" {
  address    = "demo.consul.io:80"
  datacenter = "nyc1"
}

# Access a key in Consul
resource "consul_keys" "app" {
  key {
    name    = "ami"
    path    = "service/app/launch_ami"
    default = "ami-1234"
  }
}

# Use our variable from Consul
resource "aws_instance" "app" {
  ami = "${consul_keys.app.var.ami}"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `address` - (Optional) The HTTP(S) API address of the agent to use. Defaults to "127.0.0.1:8500".
* `scheme` - (Optional) The URL scheme of the agent to use ("http" or "https"). Defaults to "http".
* `http_auth` - (Optional) HTTP Basic Authentication credentials to be used when communicating with Consul, in the format of either `user` or `user:pass`. This may also be specified using the `CONSUL_HTTP_AUTH` environment variable.
* `datacenter` - (Optional) The datacenter to use. Defaults to that of the agent.
* `token` - (Optional) The ACL token to use by default when making requests to the agent. Can also be specified with `CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN` or `CONSUL_TOKEN` as an environment variable.
* `ca_file` - (Optional) A path to a PEM-encoded certificate authority used to verify the remote agent's certificate.
* `cert_file` - (Optional) A path to a PEM-encoded certificate provided to the remote agent; requires use of `key_file`.
* `key_file`- (Optional) A path to a PEM-encoded private key, required if `cert_file` is specified.
* `ca_path` - (Optional) A path to a directory of PEM-encoded certificate authority files to use to check the authenticity of client and server connections. Can also be specified with the `CONSUL_CAPATH` environment variable.
* `insecure_https`- (Optional) Boolean value to disable SSL certificate verification; setting this value to true is not recommended for production use. Only use this with scheme set to "https".

## Environment Variables

All environment variables prefixed with `CONSUL_HTTP` listed in the [Consul environment variables](https://www.consul.io/docs/commands/index.html#environment-variables)
documentation are supported by the Terraform provider.
