Terraform Consul provider with YAML support
==================

This is a fork of the [terraform-provider-consul](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-consul) provider. The consul-yaml provider allows managing consul keys using YAML instead of the the traditional HCL or JSON formats.


Maintainers
-----------

This provider plugin is maintained by the ProdOps team at [Schoology](https://www.schoology.com/).

Requirements
------------

-	[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) 0.10.x
-	[Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.8 (to build the provider plugin)

Building The Provider
---------------------

Clone repository to: `$GOPATH/src/github.com/schoology/terraform-provider-consul-yaml`

```sh
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/schoology; cd $GOPATH/src/schoology
$ git clone https://github.com/schoology/terraform-provider-consul-yaml.git
```

Enter the provider directory and build the provider

```sh
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/schoology/terraform-provider-consul-yaml
$ make build
```

Developing the Provider
---------------------------

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (version 1.8+ is *required*). You'll also need to correctly setup a [GOPATH](http://golang.org/doc/code.html#GOPATH), as well as adding `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH`.

Once you have compiled the provider you can find binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory. To test with Terraform you will need to move the binary to your local plugin directory, located at `%APPDATA%\terraform.d\plugins` on Windows and `~/.terraform.d/plugins` on other systems.


In order to test the provider, you can simply run `make test`.

```sh
$ make test
```

In order to run the full suite of Acceptance tests, run `make testacc`.
This should be performed before merging or opening pull requests.

```sh
$ CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR=localhost:8500 make testacc
```

This requires a running Consul agent locally. This provider targets
the latest version of Consul, but older versions should be compatible where
possible. In some cases, older versions of this provider will work with
older versions of Consul.

If you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) installed, you can
run Consul with the following command:

```sh
$ make test-serv
```

By default, this will use the latest version of Consul based on the latest
image in the Docker repository. You can specify a version with the following:

```sh
$ CONSUL_VERSION=1.0.1 make test-serv
```

This command will run attached and will stop Consul when
interrupted. Images will be cached locally by Docker so it is quicky to
restart the server as necessary. This will expose Consul on the default
adddress.

Nightly acceptance tests are run against the `latest` tag of the Consul
Docker image. To run the acceptance tests against a development
version of Consul, you can [compile it](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul#developing-consul)
locally and then run it in development mode:

```
$ consul agent -dev
```
