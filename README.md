Requirements
------------

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) >= 0.13.x
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) >= 1.15

Building The Provider
---------------------

1. Clone the repository
1. Enter the repository directory
1. Build the provider using the Go `install` command:

```sh
go install
```

Developing the Provider
-----------------------

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (see [Requirements](#requirements) above).

To compile the provider, run `go install`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

Running the tests
-----------------

In order to test the provider, you can simply run `make test`.

```sh
make test
```

In order to run the full suite of Acceptance tests, run `make testacc`.
This should be performed before merging or opening pull requests.

The acceptance test will automatically look for a `consul` binary in the computer
to start a development server. The binary used by the acceptance tests can be
specified by setting the `CONSUL_TEST_BINARY` environment variable.

```sh
$ export CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN=master-token
$ make testacc
```
